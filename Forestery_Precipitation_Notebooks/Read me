The goal of this project was to determine if coastal forests increase 
precipitation further inland. Multiple phases of analysis methodology 
were attempted. Some attempts failed and are reflected here as this is
a working document.
Two study sites were selected using Global Forest Watch data. One was an
an area that underwent deforestation and one inland from site 1. 
Site 2 moisture levels would be monitored to detect any changes coinciding 
with the loss of trees. Moisture levels were discovered through both NDMI 
vegetation moisture calculations as well as remotely sensed soil moisture
levels captured with microwave and infrared sensors.
